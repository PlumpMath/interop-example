# Interop Example
C# CLR Win32 Interop Example Project

This example was written in Visual Studio 2013 using C# .NET 4.5 , C++/CLR, and Win32 C++. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to use CLR wrappers to utilize native Win32 libraries from within C#.

For simplicity, the MathFunc dll is taken from the [official Microsoft dll walkthrough](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235636.aspx).

The CLR wrapper and C# code was developed by me to learn and share how to achieve interoperation between native libraries and C# .NET without the use of P/invoke.
